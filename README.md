# Slashbase - Open-source collaborative & learning IDE for your databases in browser.
Connect to your database, browse data, run a bunch of SQL commands or share & learn SQL queries with your friends, right from your browser!

It's written in Golang and Nextjs React Framework (SPA) and runs as a single Linux binary with PostgreSQL. Documentation is currently WIP.

## Features

- **Cloud based**: Works in browser. Setup once and use everywhere. Self-host on your VPC.
